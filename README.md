# Iris Logistic Regression Classifier

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a logistic regression classifier on the Iris dataset. The main objective is to distinguish `Iris-setosa` from other Iris species using a binary classification approach. This task is essential for understanding fundamental concepts of classification algorithms and their application in machine learning

## Installation
To run this code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-logistic-regression.git
   cd iris-logistic-regression

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Ensure you have the dataset:
   Download the Iris dataset.
   Place the Iris.csv file in the project directory.

## Usage
After installation, you can run the logistic regression classifier with the following steps:

1. Run the script:
   python iris_logistic_regression.py

2. Observe the output:
   The script will output the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall of the logistic regression model.

Example Output: Hereâ€™s an example of what the output might look like:

Confusion Matrix:
[[10  0]
 [ 0 20]]

Accuracy: 1.0
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 1.0

Screenshots: Below is a screenshot of the example output:
